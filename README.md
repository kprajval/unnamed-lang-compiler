# unnamed-lang-compiler

This is a simple compiler project for a custom language called unnamed language (unn) built using C. I followed some concepts and tutorials from YouTube and added my own tweaks and improvements along the way. It was a fun challenge exploring how compilers work under the hood. The project reflects both what I learned and my own take on the process.

Thank you
